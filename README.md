### Authors and Credits
Fountainizer is the work of Thomas Sulzbacher (GUI) and Felix Batusic (parser).

The Icon was designed by Boris Baumann, thank you!

The printing is done with PDFBox, and a huge part of the printing is based on code by Lukas Theis, which he contributed to an old project (THANK YOU!!!).
